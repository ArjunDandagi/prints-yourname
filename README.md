[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/prints-yourname.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/prints-yourname)

Prints yourname , in to the console 

## USAGE:

install the package using command 

```
npm i prints-yourname
```


you can use the package like this
```
$ echo "require('prints-yourname');" > index.js
$ node index.js
```

## WHY?

just a fun package learning 


## HOW?

1. create a folder ( prints-yourname) //its already taken now , so use a different one 
2. cd <folder>
3. npm init ( and fill those details )
4. touch index.js 
5. write stuff inside index.js ( i just wrote console.log("secretstuff");)
6. npm login 
7. npm publish 

The only requirement to publish to npm registry is  package.json . how cool is that . 

I have learnt packaging for Brew , pip , apt ... but this is the one i really liked :)
